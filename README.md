# Design Pattern project

Mock-up for a travel agency app to illustrate the use of various design patterns.

**Customer**s are modeled using the [Decorator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern), **Travel**s using the [Composite pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern).

A sample use-case is included, to showcase and justify the implementation choices.
